## Todo App Made in React
Try it out here: https://mytodonow.com <br>
I created this todo app to practice my React skills. <br>
It gives you the ability to have unlimited named todo lists. <br>
It has dark/light mode and it also sorts checked/unchecked items. <br>
Right now all data is stored and retrieved from localStorage, so it is purely frontend.

### Todo
* Implement login/user authentication
* Set up backend so user can access lists from anywhere
* Implement animation on list reorder and new list creation
